Hereâ€™s a clean, ready-to-use **README description** section that you can add directly to your README file under appropriate headings:

## Student Management System

### Technologies Used

* **Java:** Core programming language for the application logic.
* **Swing:** For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **JDBC:** Java Database Connectivity to interact with MySQL.
* **MySQL:** Relational database to store student data.

### How It Works

This desktop application allows users to manage student records easily. Using a GUI, you can add new students, update their information, view all students, and delete students by roll number. The program connects to a MySQL database via JDBC to execute these operations in real time.

### How to Run

1. Create a MySQL database named `StudentDB` and a `students` table.
2. Update the database URL, username, and password in the source code (`Management.java`) according to your MySQL setup.
3. Compile the Java source code, ensuring the MySQL JDBC driver is included in your classpath.
4. Run the compiled application; the Swing GUI window will appear for use.

### Key Features

* Add student records with roll number, name, age, and marks.
* Update student details by roll number.
* View all student records in the GUI.
* Delete students using their roll number.
* Simple and intuitive user interface with immediate database updates.
